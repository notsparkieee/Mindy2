                 <br><br>
                 <h4>
                 “Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own
                 abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is 
                 able to make a contribution to his or her community.”
                        </h4>
                  <p>The WHO stress that mental health is “more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.” Peak mental health is about not only avoiding active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness and happiness.</p>

                <p>They also emphasize that preserving and restoring mental health is crucial on an individual basis, as well as throughout different communities and societies the world over.</p>

                <p>In the United States, the National Alliance on Mental Illness estimate that almost 1 in 5 adults experience mental health problems each year.</p>

                <p>In 2017, an estimated 11.2 million adults in the U.S., or about 4.5% of adults, had a severe psychological condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).</p>

                <h3>Barriers to treating childhood mental health disorders</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>It can be difficult to understand mental health disorders in children because normal childhood development is a process that involves change.
                    <p> Additionally, the symptoms of a disorder may differ depending on a child's age, and children may not be able to explain how they feel or why they are behaving a certain way.</p>

                    <p>Concerns about the stigma associated with mental illness, the use of medications, and the cost or logistical challenges of treatment might also prevent parents from seeking care for a child who has a suspected mental illness.</p>

                “The Basic Theory of the Mind” is a physical theory about the mind and its phenomena, such as consciousness and qualia. It also involves related matters including the hard problem of consciousness, the explanatory gap, variable qualia, p-zombies, and free will. This theory is a scientifically verifiable theory – it is based on physical evidence and provides experimentally testable predictions.

                Treatment for children and young people often involves talking through the problem in order to work out the best way to tackle it. For young children, this may be done through play. They may be referred to a specialist such as a counsellor who is trained to help them explore their feelings and behaviour.

                There is a lot of evidence that talking therapies can be effective for children and young people, but medication may also help in some cases. Children need to be assessed by a specialist before they are prescribed any medication.
                
                The professionals supporting a child will keep information about them and their family confidential. Young people can seek help on their own, either by ringing a helpline or by approaching a professional directly, but will usually need a parent’s consent for medical care if they’re under 16.
                
                Young people have a right to privacy if they don’t want to talk to their family about their conversations with professionals.</p>
