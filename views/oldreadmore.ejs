                 <h3>What is mental health?</h3>
                 <br><br>
                 <h4>
                 “Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own
                 abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is 
                 able to make a contribution to his or her community.”
                        </h4>
                  <p>The WHO stress that mental health is “more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.” Peak mental health is about not only avoiding active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness and happiness.</p>

                <p>They also emphasize that preserving and restoring mental health is crucial on an individual basis, as well as throughout different communities and societies the world over.</p>

                <p>In the United States, the National Alliance on Mental Illness estimate that almost 1 in 5 adults experience mental health problems each year.</p>

                <p>In 2017, an estimated 11.2 million adults in the U.S., or about 4.5% of adults, had a severe psychological condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).</p>

                <h3>Seniors and Mental Health</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>Mental health problems are common among seniors and may include isolation, affective and anxiety disorders, dementia, and psychosis, among others. Many seniors also suffer from sleep and behavioral disorders, cognitive deterioration or confusion states as a result of physical disorders or surgical interventions.</p>

                <p>Research suggests that seniors benefit from supportive social connections and close personal relationships but suffer as a result of disrupted personal ties and loneliness.</p>

                <p>Health-care providers, especially those in primary care, can play a central role in promoting mental health for seniors by working with mental health professionals, local governments, civil society organizations, families, and communities to provide comprehensive mental health care and supportive environments. In addition, older people should be encouraged to actively participate in their communities and in society at large, while policymakers should ensure that seniors' mental health concerns are addressed in national health planning and policies.</p>

                    <h3>KEY FACTS</h3>
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Globally, the population is ageing rapidly. Between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world’s population over 60 years will nearly double, from 12% to 22%.</li>
                        <li>Mental health and well-being are as important in older age as at any other time of life.</li>
                        <li>Mental and neurological disorders among older adults account for 6.6% of the total disability (DALYs) for this age group.</li>
                        <li>Approximately 15% of adults aged 60 and over suffer from a mental disorder.</li>   
                    </ul>
                    <p>Older adults, those aged 60 or above, make important contributions to society as family members, volunteers and as active participants in the workforce. While most have good mental health, many older adults are at risk of developing mental disorders, neurological disorders or substance use problems as well as other health conditions such as diabetes, hearing loss, and osteoarthritis. Furthermore, as people age, they are more likely to experience several conditions at the same time.</p>

                        <h3>Risk factors for mental health problems among older adults</h3>
                        <br><br>
                    <p>There may be multiple risk factors for mental health problems at any point in life. Older people may experience life stressors common to all people, but also stressors that are more common in later life, like a significant ongoing loss in capacities and a decline in functional ability. For example, older adults may experience reduced mobility, chronic pain, frailty or other health problems, for which they require some form of long-term care. In addition, older people are more likely to experience events such as bereavement, or a drop in socioeconomic status with retirement. All of these stressors can result in isolation, loneliness or psychological distress in older people, for which they may require long-term care.</p>
                    <p>Mental health has an impact on physical health and vice versa. For example, older adults with physical health conditions such as heart disease have higher rates of depression than those who are healthy. Additionally, untreated depression in an older person with heart disease can negatively affect its outcome.</p>
                    <p>Older adults are also vulnerable to elder abuse - including physical, verbal, psychological, financial and sexual abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious losses of dignity and respect. Current evidence suggests that 1 in 6 older people experience elder abuse. Elder abuse can lead not only to physical injuries, but also to serious, sometimes long-lasting psychological consequences, including depression and anxiety.</p>

              <p style="color: #ffff;">Today, approximately 5.8 million people in the U.S. have dementia. It’s no wonder so many caregivers are looking for tips on boosting seniors’ quality of life and finding activities for dementia patients </p>
              <p style="color: #ffff;">Only decades ago, people were still writing off dementia‑related behaviors to senility. Now researchers have an ever‑increasing understanding of the brain, which has allowed them to better identify new brain disorders, including the types of dementia.</p>
              <p style="color: #ffff;">Dementia is not a specific diagnosis on its own. Rather, dementia is a general term for any severe decline in mental abilities due to the brain's physical deterioration. Not all types of dementia are the same. </p>

                Approximately 60 percent of men and 50 percent of women will go through at least one trauma over the course of their lives, according to the National Center for PTSD. As many as eight percent of these -- eight million during any given year -- will develop PTSD. Caregiving for someone with PTSD comes with its own unique challenges, but increased understanding and awareness can lighten the load while helping them provide the very best care. Here's a closer look at PTSD, along with six tips for caregivers.

              <p style="color: #ffff;">“Despite great strides in our understanding of mental illness and vast improvements in the dialogue surrounding it, too many still suffer in silence.” This is the very first sentence in this year’s Presidential Proclamation for National Mental Health Awareness Month.  As America’s population ages, the need for mental and behavioral health services continues to grow.  Unfortunately there are many myths about aging and mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression being normal signs of aging. </p>
